<h1>Start of Liverpool Career</h1>
<p>Mané made a sensational start to his Reds career, scoring a stunning solo goal on his debut, a 4-3 win at Arsenal. He finished the season with thirteen league goals from 27 appearances, injury ruling him out of the end of the campaign. Memorable moments were the injury-time winner in the derby at Goodison Park and two goals in two minutes against Spurs at Anfield. The following season saw a major blow dealt when Mané was suspended for three games after being shown a straight red card early in the campaign at Manchester City. However, in the second half of the campaign, he excelled as part of a front three alongside Mo Salah and Robert Firmino. Mané got for the club his first hat-trick against Porto in the Champions League round of sixteen and also scored Liverpool's goal in the 3-1 final defeat to Real Madrid. </p>
